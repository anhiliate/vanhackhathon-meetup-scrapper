## Meetapp - Meetup Scrapper
This app was made in under 48 hours as a hackathon challenge.

## What it does
The platform has much to be extended, but for now it shows you what cool meetups or meetup groups are around you or around a city/address you want. It's based on categories and topics, which you can select on the feed page. From there you could also check details on a meetup, as well as details on meetup members.

## How we built it
We used ionic 3, firebase 3 and angularfire2 and the Meetup API.

It is ideal that you access it from your phone, and it also can be added to your home page as the app is also a progressive web app!
